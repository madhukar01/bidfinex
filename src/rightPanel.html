	      <p>Auctionhouse is a decentralized application (Dapp) that lets
	      users auction off non-fungible on-chain assets. What does this
	      mean?  When you have fungible assets like Augur REP tokens, you
	      can easily sell them on an exchange since they're all
	      interchangeable. But when you have a token that represents
	      something one-of-a-kind, something unique, it's better served to
	      auction it off, since there's no liquidity on exchanges for these
	      one off items.</p>
